## Making Changes

To make changes to the content of the website, edit the respective HTML files.

You can do this in a variety of ways:

-   by cloning the repository and editing the files locally
-   by editing the files directly on GitHub (by clicking the pencil icon on the top right of the file you want to edit). This options is the easiest way to make small changes.
-   If you want to make larger changes, you can also open a web-based editor by clicking the "Open in github.dev" button in the dropdown menu on the top right of the file you want to edit. The online editor can also be opened by pressing "`.`" on the keyboard while viewing the repository on GitHub.
